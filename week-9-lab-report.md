# Week 9 Lab Report
## Part 1 - Debugging Scenario
**Student Post**<br>
![bug output](bug_OP.png)<br>
  Hi! I wanted to know if I could get any help with my code. I assume it's my conditional in my `grade.sh` bash script that decides how much credit the student gets and whetehr or not they passed. It claims that the corrected `ListExamples` method repository didn't pass but doesn't correctly report the number of tests run and doesn't show what .
**TA Response**<br>
  Can you make sure that you are using the correct assert methods for your tester methods and that you are comparing the correct expected and actual outputs?




The original post from a student with a screenshot showing a symptom and a description of a guess at the bug/some sense of what the failure-inducing input is. (Don't actually make the post! Just write the content that would go in such a post)
A response from a TA asking a leading question or suggesting a command to try (To be clear, you are mimicking a TA here.)
Another screenshot/terminal output showing what information the student got from trying that, and a clear description of what the bug is.
At the end, all the information needed about the setup including:
The file & directory structure needed
The contents of each file before fixing the bug
The full command line (or lines) you ran to trigger the bug
A description of what to edit to fix the bug
You should actually set up and run the scenario from your screenshots. It should involve at least a Java file and a bash script. Describing the bug should involve reading some output at the terminal resulting from running one or more commands. Design an error that produces more interesting output than a single message about a syntax or unbound identifier error – showcase some interesting wrong behavior! Feel free to set this up by cloning and breaking some existing code like the grading script or code from class, or by designing something of your own from scratch, etc.
